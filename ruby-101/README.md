# RUBY NOTES


### Ruby is:
* High-level:  meaning reading and writing Ruby is really easyâ€”it looks a lot like regular English!
* Interpreted,no compiler to write and run Ruby.
* Object-oriented, meaning it allows users to manipulate data structures called objects in order to build and execute programs.
* Easy to use. 
  * Designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto (often just called "Matz") in 1995. Designed to emphasize human needs over those of the computer.


### Ruby Syntax
- Comments: 
  ```
  # Single line Comments
    
  =begin
    Multi
    Line
    Comments
  =end
  ```
- Methods: 
  ```
  .reverse
  .uppercase
  .lowercase
  ```
- Console:
  ```
  puts <items> (new lines for each entry)
  print <items> (same line)
  ```
- Getting Input
  use `gets`. ` .chomp` removes the blank line that is automatically inserted. E.g.,
  ```
  first_name = gets.chomp
  ```
- String Interpolation
  ```
  print "I took #{monkey} to the zoo"
  ```
